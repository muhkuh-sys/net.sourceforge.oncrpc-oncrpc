-----

This project creates a library called oncrpc.lib which contains all the
ONCRPC code for writing client and server applications. The library can be
found in :

win32/librpc/lib/Debug and win32/librpc/lib/Release

It also creates an executable called portmap which is required to
run on the machine where ONCRPC services are to be run. It can be
run as a standalone program or installed as a Windows service.

COMPILING
---------

A Visual C++ project files can be found in the librpc/lib for recompiling
the library.
